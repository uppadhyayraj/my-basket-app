# Challenge 3.4.4: Vague Prompts = Dangerous Code

## 📌 The Thesis
**Vague Prompts = Dangerous Code.** As AI takes over the heavy lifting of coding, your role has shifted from **Writer** to **Reviewer**. Your ability to read and critique code must now exceed your ability to write it.

---

## 🧪 The Experiment
We compared two ways of asking an AI to fix a bug in an "Order Status" system.

### Action A: The Vague Prompt
> *"Fix the Order status logic."*
* **The Result:** The AI went "hunting." It fixed a documentation error **and** deleted unused code it found elsewhere.
* **The Risk:** It stayed safe *this time*, but it took creative liberties. It could have easily "fixed" working logic, breaking the system.

### Action B: The Specific Prompt
> *"Review #file:swagger.ts and #file:types.ts to ensure OrderStatus values match. Update if missing."*
* **The Result:** A "surgical strike." The AI fixed the one specific discrepancy and stopped.
* **The Benefit:** The change was predictable, easy to review, and stayed exactly within the requested boundaries.

## 📊 Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | Vague Prompt ("Fix it") | Specific Prompt ("Do X in File Y") |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Control** | 🔴 **Low** (AI guesses your intent) | 🟢 **High** (You direct the AI) |
| **Scope** | ⚠️ **Creeps** (Fixes things not asked for) | ✅ **Targeted** (Only touches what is needed) |
| **Review Time** | ⏳ **Slow** (Must check everything) | ⚡ **Fast** (Know exactly what changed) |
| **Risk Level** | 🟡 **Medium/High** | 🟢 **Low** |

## 🛠 Your New Workflow: "Human-in-the-Loop"

AI coding agents are powerful but unpredictable. Follow these four rules to stay safe:

1.  **Be a PR Reviewer:** Treat the AI like a talented, overeager junior developer. Never merge without reading every single line.
2.  **Specificity is Safety:** Use file references (`#file:path`) and exact function names. Tell the AI what **not** to touch.
3.  **Trust, but Verify:** Run your test suite before and after the AI makes a change. If the tests pass, you're safer; if they fail, the AI overstepped.
4.  **Watch for Hallucinations:** AI can sound confident even when it's wrong. Verify that the "problem" the AI says it found actually exists.

## 💡 The Takeaway

* **Don't say:** "Clean up the code."
* **Do say:** "Remove unused imports in `user-service.ts`."

**Vague prompts are Russian Roulette. Specific prompts are surgical strikes.**
