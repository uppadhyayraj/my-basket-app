# Challenge 3.1.4: Create a Prompt Library
**TASK**
Create a "Prompt Library" for the team to standardize and accelerate development by providing reusable AI prompt templates for common tasks: unit testing, integration testing, and code refactoring.

**RATING**
 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5 Stars)

 It was alot better using unit-test.prompt.md then using manual prompts only thing is it had to do 2 rewrites in the process of getting all the tests to pass. Main issue I opserved was it having issues setting up the mock
