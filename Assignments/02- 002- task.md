# Task: Health Check Test Suite with Playwright API Testing Framework

## Objective
Generate comprehensive Playwright TypeScript API tests covering all 7 critical health check issues and implement solutions to pass those tests.

## Checklist

### Planning
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Review test framework structure (Playwright + POM)
- [ ] Define API endpoints for testing

### Test Framework Setup
- [ ] Create Playwright project structure
- [ ] Setup package.json with Playwright dependencies
- [ ] Configure playwright.config.ts
- [ ] Setup TypeScript configuration
- [ ] Create base API class for HTTP methods
- [ ] Setup authentication handler
- [ ] Create response validation utilities

### Page Object Models (API Endpoints)
- [ ] Create HealthCheckAPI page object
- [ ] Create LivenessAPI page object
- [ ] Create ReadinessAPI page object
- [ ] Create CartAPI page object (for integration tests)

### Test Suite Creation - Covering 7 Critical Issues
- [ ] **Issue 1:** Dependency validation tests (Product Service up/down)
- [ ] **Issue 2:** Liveness vs readiness endpoint tests
- [ ] **Issue 3:** Timeout handling tests
- [ ] **Issue 4:** Memory/resource monitoring tests
- [ ] **Issue 5:** Observability and metrics tests
- [ ] **Issue 6:** Error handling tests
- [ ] **Issue 7:** Docker health check validation tests

### Comprehensive Test Cases per Endpoint
- [ ] Valid requests with all required fields
- [ ] Invalid authentication scenarios
- [ ] Missing required fields
- [ ] Invalid data types and formats
- [ ] Response time and performance checks
- [ ] Error response validation
- [ ] Integration workflow tests

### Implementation (Cart Service)
- [ ] Create health check service with dependency validation
- [ ] Implement liveness and readiness endpoints
- [ ] Add timeout configuration to Product Service client
- [ ] Add memory/resource monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add observability/metrics support
- [ ] Update routes with new health check endpoints

### Infrastructure Updates
- [ ] Update docker-compose.yml with health check config
- [ ] Update Swagger documentation
- [ ] Add environment configuration files (dev, staging, prod)

### Verification
- [ ] Run Playwright test suite
- [ ] Verify all 7 critical issues are covered
- [ ] Generate HTML test report
- [ ] Verify Docker health checks work
- [ ] Test integration with API Gateway
