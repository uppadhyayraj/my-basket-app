- [x] Create Implementation Plan (`implementation_plan.md`)

## Phase 2: Test Framework Development
- [x] Setup Playwright project structure
- [x] Create Base API and Page Object Models (POM)
- [x] Define Type interfaces for health responses
- [x] Create Test Fixtures and Utility functions
- [x] Create Test Suites for each identified issue:
    - [x] Issue 1: Dependency Validation
    - [x] Issue 2: Liveness/Readiness distinction
    - [x] Issue 3: Timeout handling
    - [x] Issue 4: Resource monitoring
    - [x] Issue 5: Error handling

    - [x] Issue 7: Docker health checks
    - [x] Issue 8: Observability metrics
    - [x] Integration & Workflows

## Phase 3: Implementation of Improvements
- [x] Implement `HealthCheckService` logic
- [x] Update `ProductServiceClient` with timeouts and health checks
- [x] Implement `/api/health`, `/api/health/live`, `/api/health/ready` routes
- [x] Update `types.ts` and `swagger.ts`
- [x] Update `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` with health checks

## Phase 4: Verification & Final Handover
- [x] Run test suite and verify all 40+ tests pass
- [x] Perform manual verification with Docker Compose
- [x] Generate final test reports (HTML/JSON)
- [x] Create `walkthrough.md` with proof of work
- [x] Final documentation update
