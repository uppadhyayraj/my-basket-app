# I tried the following prompts:
@workspace How is this application structured? Explain how the API Gateway routes requests to the Product Service.

# Response:
I have investigated the application structure and API Gateway routing.

Application Structure
The application is a monorepo following a microservices architecture, orchestrated via Docker Compose.

Frontend: A Next.js application running on port 9002.
Microservices: Located in the microservices/ directory:
api-gateway (Port 3000): The entry point for all API requests.
product-service (Port 3001): Manages product data.
cart-service (Port 3002)
order-service (Port 3003)
ai-service (Port 3004)
API Gateway Routing Logic
The api-gateway is an Express application that uses http-proxy-middleware to forward requests.

Configuration: Routing rules are defined in microservices/api-gateway/src/config.ts.
Product Route:
typescript
{
  name: 'product-service',
  url: process.env.PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:3001',
  path: '/api/products',
  healthCheck: '/api/health',
}
Mechanism:
The gateway listens on port 3000.
Incoming requests matching /api/products are proxied to the Product Service (http://product-service:3001).
The path is preserved during forwarding (e.g., /api/products on the gateway maps to /api/products on the service).
Product Service Endpoints
The product-service listens on port 3001 and mounts its routes under /api.

Defined in microservices/product-service/src/routes.ts.
Matches the forwarded path:
GET /api/products -> Returns all products.
GET /api/products/:id -> Returns a specific product.
