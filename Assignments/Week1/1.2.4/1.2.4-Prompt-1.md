@workspace I am conducting a security and performance audit of our architecture. Please locate the definition for the API Gateway's rate-limiting and routing rules.

Identify the specific configuration file (e.g., within microservices/api-gateway/) where these limits are declared.

Analyze the code to find the requests per minute (RPM) threshold.

Specifically, identify the value that triggers a 429 (Too Many Requests) error.

Please provide the full file path and the exact numeric value found.
