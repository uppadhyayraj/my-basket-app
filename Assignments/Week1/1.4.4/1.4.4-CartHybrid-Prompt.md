# ROLE
Senior Full-Stack SDET (Software Developer in Test) specializing in Playwright and Asynchronous Integration Testing.

# CONTEXT
We are validating the data integrity bridge between our Node.js backend (cart-service) and our React frontend (CartView.tsx). The goal is to ensure that a server-side state change is correctly hydrated into the UI without client-side mocking.

# TASK
Write a Playwright integration test (cart-hybrid.spec.ts) that executes a "Seed-to-UI" flow:

Arrange (API Seeding): * Use the request utility (APIRequestContext) to send a POST request to /api/cart.

Pass a valid payload (e.g., { productId: '123', quantity: 1 }).

Validate the API response is 201 Created or 200 OK before proceeding.

Act (UI Navigation): * Navigate the browser (page.goto) to the Cart UI route.

Ensure the page has fully loaded or the "Get" request from the frontend has completed.

Assert (DOM Verification): * Verify the seeded item is visible in the cart sidebar/list.

Strict Requirement: Use user-facing locators (e.g., getByRole, getByText, or getByTestId) rather than brittle CSS selectors.

Cleanup (Teardown):

Implement an afterEach or afterAll hook to DELETE the item via API to maintain a clean test environment.

# CONSTRAINTS
Testing Pattern: Follow the Hybrid Integration pattern (Procedure B for seeding, Procedure A for UI validation).

No Mocking: Do not use page.route() to intercept the cart GET request. The UI must fetch real data from the backend.

Robustness: Include a specific expect for a unique attribute of the seeded item (like the name or SKU) to prevent false positives.

Performance: The API seeding must happen directly via the request context, not by "clicking" through the UI to add items.
